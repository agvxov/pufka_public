# Pufka
This document started out as a cheat-sheet for myself.
This went well, I can find tons of stuff more easily here then on google.
(Partially because I'm not a journalist desperately trying to stretch out
my point for as long as possible to gain more add space.)
Then I realized that putting concepts and
methods into the simplest terms I can really helps me to get a deeper understanding.
As a result there plenty of parts which reads like a tutorial.
Pufka already serves it's purpose very well by helping me,
however perhaps it can assist someone else too.

## WARNING
While I would like to think most of the information contained is quite on point,
I know for a fact that some parts are quite lacking and
likely there are others which are just wrong.
Use it at your own risk. 

## Highlighting:
+ Pufka uses a special syntax called "cdd",
its cpp grammar with many extensions to specialize it in note taking
+ using vim + cdd.vim is highly advised
+ cpp highlighting is your second best bet

## Name
Dubious spelling of the Hungarian word "rifle" ("puska"),
which is a synonym for cheat-sheet.

## Public?
Public.
I have a private version,
version controlled along side with a number of
notes and scripts (e.g. auto index assigner).
The commit history of the public version is reset on every sync.
